// This file allows exposing the result of the build of the `../src` folder as
// assets that can be used from a backend service. Specifically, the assets map
// bellow exposes both the asset items from their manifest, as well as a method
// to get the stream data (as a Readable stream) of the asset.

// When this library is used as a NodeJS dependency (typically from
// node_modules), the assets will simply read on disk from the node_modules
// directory. However, if this file is bundled (e.g. via rollup), the assets
// need to be copied to the bundler's output directory for the code bellow to
// work. Most bundlers support this (webpack, rollup, etc.) by re-writing `new
// URL('./path', import.meta.url)` calls to point to the correct output
// directory.

// However, that syntax only works in ESM modules. Atproto uses CJS modules, so,
// at the moment, the logic bellow is **not** compatible with bundlers. To allow
// bundling this file as a CJS module, the code bellow should not be dependent
// on reading the files on disk. This can be done by modifying the build system
// to embed the asset bytes directly into the bundle-manifest.json (see the
// `data` option of "@atproto-labs/rollup-plugin-bundle-manifest" in
// rollup.config.js).

// https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/795
// https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web/rollup-plugin-import-meta-assets

// Note that the bundle-manifest -- being a JSON file -- can be imported
// directly without any special handling. This is because both bundlers and
// NodeJS, support JSON imports out of the box.
