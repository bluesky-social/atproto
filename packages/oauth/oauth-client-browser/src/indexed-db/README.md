# IndexedDB utilities

This is a small wrapper around the IndexedDB API that provides a simple way to
store and retrieve data from an IndexedDB database.

This _could_ be used as a standalone library, but the Bluesky dev team does not
want to maintain it as such. As it is currently only used by the
`@atproto/oauth-client-browser` package, it is included here.
