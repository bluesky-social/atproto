- [Lexicon CLI](./lex-cli/): A command-line application for generating code and documentation from Lexicon schemas.

## Libraries

- [API](./api): A library for communicating with atproto servers.
- [Common](./common): A library containing code which is shared between atproto packages.
- [Crypto](./crypto): Atproto's common cryptographic operations.
- [Syntax](./syntax): A library for identifier syntax: NSID, AT URI, handles, etc.
- [Lexicon](./lexicon): A library for validating data using atproto's schema system.

## Benchmarking and profiling

Only applicable to packages which contain benchmarks(`jest.bench.config.js`).

You can run benchmarks with `pnpm bench`.

### Attaching a profiler

Running `pnpm bench:profile` will launch `bench` with `--inspect-brk` flag.
Execution will be paused until a debugger is attached, you can read more
about node debuggers [here](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started#inspector-clients)

An easy way to profile is:

1. open `about://inspect` in chrome
2. select which process to connect to(there will probably only be one)
3. go to performance tab
4. press record, this will unpause execution
5. wait for the benches to run
6. finish recording
