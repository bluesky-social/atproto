The non-standard `revocation_endpoint_auth_method`, and `revocation_endpoint_auth_signing_alg` client metadata properties were removed. The client's `token_endpoint_auth_method`, and `token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg` properties are now used as the only indication of how a client must authenticate at the revocation endpoint.
