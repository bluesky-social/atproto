## Rules & Guidelines

While we do accept contributions, we prioritize high-quality issues and pull requests. Adhering to the below guidelines will ensure a more timely review.

### Rules:

- We may not respond to your issue or PR.
- We may close an issue or PR without much feedback.
- We may lock discussions or contributions if our attention is getting DDOSed.

### Guidelines:

- Check for existing issues before filing a new one, please.
- Open an issue and give some time for discussion before submitting a PR.
- If submitting a PR that includes a lexicon change, please get sign off on the lexicon change _before_ doing the implementation.
- Issues are for bugs & feature requests related to the TypeScript implementation of atproto and related services. For high-level discussions, please you the [Discussion Forum](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/discussions). For client issues, please use the relevant [social-app](https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app) repo
- Stay away from PRs that:
  - Refactor large parts of the codebase
  - Add entirely new features without prior discussion
  - Change the tooling or frameworks used without prior discussion
  - Introduce new unnecessary dependencies

Remember, we serve a wide community of users. Our day-to-day involves us constantly asking "which top priority is our top priority." If you submit well-written PRs that solve problems concisely, that's an awesome contribution. Otherwise, as much as we'd love to accept your ideas and contributions, we really don't have the bandwidth.

## Are you a developer interested in building on atproto?

Bluesky is an open social network built on the AT Protocol, a flexible technology that will never lock developers out of the ecosystems that they help build. With atproto, third-party can be as seamless as first-party through custom feeds, federated services, clients, and more.

If you're a developer interested in building on atproto, we'd love to email you a Bluesky invite code. Simply share your GitHub (or similar) profile with us via [this form](https://forms.gle/BF21oxVNZiDjDhXF9).
