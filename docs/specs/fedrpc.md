# Federated Remote Procedure Calls (FedRPC)

FedRPC is a general purpose server-to-server messaging protocol. It was created for the ADX protocol but is a generic communications layer which can be applied to multiple use-cases (and which does not include any ADX-specific semantics). The [repository data layer](./repo.md) and social applications operate as layers atop FedRPC.

Features:

- **Contract-oriented**. All "methods" in FedRPC are declared by schemas which define the accepted inputs and outputs. Schemas are globally identified and published as machine-readable documents. This helps ensure correctness and consistency across an open network of services.
- **HTTP-based**. FedRPC methods are transported using HTTP/S, using GET or POST methods depending on the behavior. This makes FedRPC easy to understand and easy to integrate into existing tech stacks.
- **Cacheable**. FedRPC's "query" methods are designed to cache well with common HTTP-based caching techniques.
- **Support for multiple encodings**. FedRPC supports structured data (JSON) and unstructured binary blobs.

## TODOs

- Authentication
- Schema versioning & extensibility
- Define `getSchema`

## Specification

FedRPC supports client-to-server and server-to-server messaging over HTTP/S. Each user has a "Personal Data Server (PDS)" which acts as their agent in the network, meaning most (if not all) of their communication is routed through their PDS.

### Methods

FedRPC "Methods" possess the following attributes:

- **ID**: The ID of the schema for the method's inputs and outputs.
- **Type**: Query (non-effectful, cacheable) or Procedure (effectful, non-cacheable).
- **Parameters**: Encoded in the URI query segment. Affects caching.
- **Input**: The request body.
- **Output**: The response body.

#### Method IDs

Methods are identified using [NSIDs](./nsid.md), a form of [Reverse Domain-Name Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation).

Some example method IDs:

```
com.example.status
io.social.getFeed
net.users.bob.ping
```

#### Method schemas

Method schemas are encoded in JSON and adhere to the following interface:

```typescript
interface MethodSchema {
  fedrpc: 1
  id: string
  type: 'query' | 'procedure'
  description?: string
  parameters?: Record<string, MethodParam> // a map of param names to their definitions
  input?: MethodBody
  output?: MethodBody
}

interface MethodParam {
  type: 'string' | 'number' | 'integer' | 'boolean'
  description?: string
  default?: string | number | boolean
  required?: boolean
  minLength?: number // string only
  maxLength?: number // string only
  minimum?: number // number and integer only
  maximum?: number // number and integer only
}

interface MethodBody {
  encoding: string | string[] // must be a valid mimetype
  schema?: JSONSchema // json only
}
```

An example query-method schema:

```json
{
  "fedrpc": 1,
  "id": "io.social.getFeed",
  "type": "query",
  "description": "Fetch the user's latest feed.",
  "parameters": {
    "limit": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 50},
    "cursor": {"type": "string"},
    "reverse": {"type": "boolean", "default": true}
  },
  "output": {
    "encoding": "application/json",
    "schema": {
      "type": "object",
      "required": ["entries", "totalCount"],
      "properties": {
        "entries": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
            "type": "object",
            "description": "Entry items will vary and are not constrained at the method level"
          }
        },
        "totalCount": {"type": "number"}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

An example procedure-method schema:

```json
{
  "fedrpc": 1,
  "id": "io.social.setProfilePicture",
  "type": "procedure",
  "description": "Set the user's avatar.",
  "input": {
    "encoding": ["image/png", "image/jpg"],
  }
}
```

#### Schema distribution

Method schemas are designed to be machine-readable and network-accessible. While it is not current _required_ that a schema is available on the network, it is strongly advised to publish schemas so that a single canonical & authoritative representation is available to consumers of the method.

To fetch a schema, a request must be sent to the builtin [`getSchema`](#getschema) method. This request is sent to the authority of the NSID.

### Built-in methods

#### `getSchema`

TODO

### Requests

#### HTTP Method

The HTTP Method used depends on the `type` specified by the method schema.

|Type|Method|
|-|-|
|`query`|`GET`|
|`procedure`|`POST`|

#### Path

All requests are sent to the `/fedrpc/{methodId}` path on the target server. For example, a call to the `io.social.getFeed` method would be sent to `/fedrpc/io.social.getFeed` path.

The parameters (as specified in the [Method schema](#method-schemas)) are encoded as query parameters. The values should be encoded using the following algorithm in pseudo-javascript:

```js
function encodeParam (paramType, value) {
  if (paramType === 'boolean') {
    return value ? 'true' : 'false'
  } else {
    return encodeURIComponent(value)
  }
}
```

If a default value is specified in the method schema, that value should be included in requests to ensure consistent caching behaviors.

#### Headers

|Header|Usage|
|-|-|
|`Content-Type`|Must specify the encoding of the request body if present.|
|`Authentication`|May specify the authentication data if present. See [Authentication](#authentication) for more information.|

### Responses

Response types are identified by the HTTP status codes.

#### `200` Request successful

The request has succeeded. Expectations:

- `Content-Type` header must be populated.
- Response body will vary by the method interface.

#### `400` Invalid request

The request is invalid and was not processed. Expecations:

- `Content-Type` header must be `application/json`.
- Response body must match the [InvalidRequest](#invalidrequest) schema.

#### `401` Authentication required

The request cannot be processed without authentication. Expectations:

- `WWW-Authenticate` header must be populated with an authentication challenge. See [Authentication](#authentication) for more information.

#### `403` Forbidden

The user lacks the needed permissions to access the method.

#### `404` FedRPC not supported

The interpretation of a `404` response is somewhat unique for FedRPC. A `404` indicates that the server does not provide a resource at the given location (`/fedrpc`) meaning the server does not support FedRPC.

To indicate that the given procedure is not implemented, use the `501` response.

#### `413` Payload too large

The payload of the request is larger than the server is willing to process. Payload size-limits are decided by each server.

#### `429` Rate limit exceeded

The client has sent too many requests. Rate-limits are decided by each server. Expectations:

- `Retry-After` header may be populated with the amount of time that must pass before the next request.

#### `500` Internal server error

The server reached an unexpected condition during processing. Expecations:

- `Content-Type` header must be `application/json`.
- Response body must match the [InternalError](#internalerror) schema.

#### `501` Procedure not implemented

The server does not implement the requested procedure.

#### `502` A request to upstream failed

The execution of the procedure depends on a call to another server which has failed. Expecations:

- `Content-Type` header must be `application/json`.
- Response body must match the [UpstreamError](#upstreamerror) schema.

#### `503` Not enough resources

The server is under heavy load and can't complete the request.

#### `504` A request to upstream timed out

The execution of the procedure depends on a call to another server which timed out. Expecations:

- `Content-Type` header must be `application/json`.
- Response body must match the [UpstreamError](#upstreamerror) schema.

#### Remaining codes

Any response code not explicitly enumerated should be handled as follows:

- `1xx` treat as a `404`
- `2xx` treat as a `200`
- `3xx` treat as a `404` (redirects are not supported)
- `4xx` treat as a `400`
- `5xx` treat as a `500`

### Authentication

### Response schemas

The following schemas are used within the FedRPC protocol.

#### `InvalidRequest`

```typescript
interface InvalidRequest {
  error: true
  type: 'InvalidRequest'
  message: string
}
```

#### `InternalError`

```typescript
interface InternalError {
  error: true
  type: 'InternalError'
  message: string
}
```

#### `UpstreamError`

```typescript
interface UpstreamError {
  error: true
  type: 'UpstreamError'
  message: string
}
```
